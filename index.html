                            <p>1v1.LOL is a competitive online third-person shooter where you build your way around the map tactically. You can build platforms, ramps, and walls to aid your defenses and gain an advantage. The main game mode is 1v1 battle royale, where the winner is the last player standing.</p>
                            <h3>How to Play</h3>
                            <p>How you play 1v1.lol depends on the game mode. In most cases, you’ll be playing battle royale, so your objectives to eliminate opponents and become the last survivor.</p>
                            <p>You’ll have a selection of weapons, including an ax for tearing down your opponents’ walls. Along with your weapons, there are four building blocks bound to your keys for quick access.</p>
                            <p>1v1.lol is a highly tactical and competitive shooter, where fast and effective building is just as important as having sharp aim and quick reactions. Thankfully, you can practice your building skills in build mode, without dealing with gunfights.</p>
                            <h3>How to build in 1v1.LOL</h3>
                            <p>Building in 1v1.LOL is eerily similar to Fortnite, but in a good way. You can build and edit your walls in the same way as you would in Fortnite. This means any familiar players will know exactly how to crank 90s with ease.</p>
                            <p>If you aren’t used to building, try and customise the controls to something more familiar. It especially helps to use the mouse wheel, rather than any individual keys if you are playing 1v1.LOL unblocked.</p>
                            <p>Objects you can build:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wall</li>
                                <li>Floor</li>
                                <li>Stairs</li>
                                <li>Triangular roof</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Building on mobile is a lot more difficult than on 1v1.LOL unblocked. It will take a lot of practice and patience to be able to build like a pro. Make sure cross-platform play is turned off if you are want to avoid playing 1v1.LOL unblocked PC players.</p>
